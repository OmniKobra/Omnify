# Security Policy

## Introduction

The Omnify team is committed to maintianing the security, integrity and safety of all our users' data and transactions. This security policy outlines our procedures for handling security vulnerabilities and our disclosure policy.

## Supported Versions

This project only supports the latest release which is `v1.1.9` for the landing page and `v1.2.0` for the dapp. We recommend that users always use the latest version of Omnify.

## Disclosure Guidelines

We follow a private disclosure policy. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately via email or telegram to any of the contacts listed above. We will work to resolve it as quickly as possible.

We will not publicly disclose security vulnerabilities until a patch or fix is available.
